# Secrets

This is an application where users could anonymously post their secrets while others can see it in a common thread. Developed using node.js/express and user data stored using MongoDB and Mongoose. Google and facebook login is implemented. The application uses passport.js to authenticate and googleAuth and facebookAuth is also used. Environment variables are used all over the code which means that to run the code it might be needed to replace those variables with custom values.

## How to run the application: 
install the files -go into the directory and run "npm i" -then run "node app.js" and then go to "http://localhost:3000"
